                        <p>
                            One day the flesh on my cheeks will wilt,<br>
                            And I will have tree rings all over,<br> 
                            And I will grit my eternal teeth, weeping,<br>
                            As my peers are planted<br>
                            Down in the soil.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the bathroom floor sat Claire, her damp towel falling from under her arms. 
                            She rested her upper body over the closed toilet seat, weeping as though it were her gravestone. 
                            I watched her breath mingle with the shower steam, escaping and then recaptured in high-pitched gasps. 
                            She'd only cut her leg shaving, but now she was in such a state that she couldn't even stand.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                                People are capable of feeling all sorts of emotions during the revivification process, said the leaflet, they can come to anyone: 
                                you, your loved ones, or perhaps the family of your donor. 
                                It is important that you accept these feelings as they come to you.
                            </i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I hovered awkwardly in the doorway. When these episodes had first started, we'd agreed that it was for the best to leave doors unlocked. 
                            Now I was in this liminal position, trying to decide what was the best for her: company or solitude. 
                            The tightening of her fists on the toilet seat cover and the occasional twitch of her legs suggested that she was trying to regain some control, 
                            but when she looked to her wound and spotted the beads of blood dripping down onto the bathroom tiles, she collapsed all over again. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I intruded over the threshold, taking a roll of toilet paper and breaking off a few squares so I could  kneel and press them to her calf. 
                            She had barely noticed the cat when it nudged and pawed at her earlier, but the human contact caused her to flinch and hide her face in the towelled toilet seat. 
                            I took care to not look at her, to let her experience her embarrassment and not complicate it with words or sentiment. 
                            It was impossible to flush the toilet paper with her sprawled across the toilet seat like that, so I put it in the bathroom bin, shutting the plastic lid as quietly as possible. 
                            When I returned with a fresh wad for her leg, I heard her muffled croak:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “Being alive is just terrifying.” <br><br>
                            It was a whisper at first, but then her voice cracked.<br><br>
                            “You don't have any idea..!” <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fact that her speech was directed at me gave me a green light to engage her a little more. 
                            I placed a hand at her back, thumb lightly grazing her spine, timing my movements to her breath to see if I could slow her down. 
                            Learning to deal with Claire's panic attacks was like cracking a safe. 
                            You had to listen closely, respond carefully, and then you could get past the steel to the precious thing inside. 
                            Speaking to her at this point would overload her. She was letting the thoughts out now, and I had to let it happen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was like ghosts leaving a haunted house. It was like fumigation. 
                            <br>It was like some other poetic, pretentious way of describing a naked crying woman, terrified of her own blood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>These feelings are all natural, and will pass with time,</i> advised the leaflet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It had been three weeks now. An episode happened once every few days. Perhaps the amount of time she wasted, paralysed and weeping had crossed her mind too, because a new batch of tears spilled over her cheeks. Claire's arms were covered in goosebumps, a horrible familiar chill. The steam from the shower was long gone now, and the towel was warm only by of the heat of her body. Would it be too soon to move her? I glanced around to the radiator; the open bathroom window; the hoodie hung up on the door.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Those revived may find it helpful to think of the here and now, and to live as they did once before. 
                            <br>Try to take this time to appreciate the beautiful world around you once again.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “I'm so scared, I'm too scared to do it again, I can't-”
                            <br>Maybe I acted too soon, but it felt right to rest my forehead on her shoulder, letting my chest warm her back. 
                            Her breathing had become far more like my own, to my relief. To hear Claire breathing normally was such a gift; 
                            I had been the only person around to hear her death rattle. Our fingers had been interlinked, 
                            her pulse touching mine until it could no longer. My eyes settled on the red on the bathroom tiles.
                            <br>I said, “I know, darling.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Soon, you will be back on track with your life, thanks to the kindness of your donor!</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I said, "I'm scared too."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A donation of life heals you; heals all parts of you that can be healed. In a little room with two blue chairs and a bed, we watched as those harebell bruises at her collarbone bloomed indigo. Then the petals faded away, and she was underneath unscathed. Her eyelids, dead fragile leaves, were rejuvenated next. I wanted nothing more than to kiss them - but that was her mother's job, who gripped her hand tightly as the revival began.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The term midwife is a marriage of the Middle English word mid (meaning: with) and wife (meaning: a woman). Her mother, Barbara, was with woman in the same way that she was once with child, ready to welcome her flesh back to the world of the living. A sudden unconscious gasp, a reversal in death, and the grey-haired woman began to cry in relief. I dared not move, terrified of interrupting her child's rising chest. So instead I linked my fingers with Claire's, and thanked whoever was listening for letting us have this moment. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The doctor said that it was his pleasure, and announced that the transfusion had been a success. 
                            <br>The donor's funeral was held later that afternoon. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Barbara called me a month after the bathroom incident – how was Claire? Was she doing any better? I explained that Claire seemed to be settling down more now, she hadn't had any episodes this week, although she was still struggling to fully accept that she was alive. Her mother and I were her support network. We were her recovery aids. We alone had to ease her back into the world.
                            <br>“She's started asking questions,” I reported, “there's things about that day she doesn't remember, but I've been telling her not to think about it too much.”
                            <br>“The leaflet says we should answer gradually.” Barbara's voice buzzed down the phone-line. Claire was in the garden, pulling up weeds from the flowerbeds. I watched her from the window. Speaking about her like this felt wrong; I was her spouse, not her caretaker. She deserved to know. 
                            <br>“She hasn't asked you about Paul yet?” I broached the subject. Claire hadn't even mentioned her father to me. He hadn't seen her in months, even before the revival. 
                            <br>“She said that she understood that he couldn't travel all the way from Wales to Scotland with a wheelchair, and told me to tell him not to feel bad.”
                            <br>I didn't know what to say. Barbara sighed after a long pause, and I ventured:
                            <br>“Is there anything I can do?”
                            <br>“My dear, you're doing enough for me just as you are. I'll come and visit you both next month. Ta-ta, love.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “Frances.”
                            <br>Claire appeared in the doorway, pulling off her gardening gloves. She put them on the cabinet, next to the NHS Revivification leaflet. She fidgeted with a forget-me-not she'd found outside.
                            <br>“I want to go to where it happened. Can you drive me?”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was a slow drive through the countryside. Claire tried to convince me that I could drive faster, that she didn't mind - but her shaking hands told me otherwise. As we reached the bridge, she played with her scarf, refusing to look out and see the height.
                            <br>“I never realised, life has a taste.” Claire tried to distract herself.
                            <br>“Really?”
                            <br>“You can't notice it normally, it's what the inside of your mouth tastes like. Sometimes you taste someone else's life when you kiss them.” she murmured, “This one tastes different, I guess.” 
                            <br>I glanced down from the road to see her weaving the stalk of the flower from earlier into the fringe of her scarf.
                            <br>“Do you miss your own?”
                            <br>Seeing we were past the bridge, she looked up and shook her head.
                            <br>“This one doesn't taste too different. It's familiar. Maybe we liked the same things.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When we were close by, I pulled over into a turning point, letting the car roll up onto the grass. We sat together, staring off into the woods. In the rear-view mirror was the road, and then the fence. And then the drop. 
                            <br>“It wasn't this car I was driving, was it.”
                            <br>“No, it was yours. We had to get it scrapped.”
                            <br>Claire's eyes wouldn't leave the forest. I could see a tear forming, but she blinked the dew away.
                            <br>“I really liked that car.”
                            <br>She was watching the clump of sweet peas that had grown at the edge of the forest.
                            <br>“It didn't take them long to get to you, I was talking to you on loudspeaker when you had the seizure.” I spoke softly, running my thumb over the back of her hand. I was grateful that she recalled no part of this; I could remember every sound. 
                            <br>“What were we talking about?” She asked softly, knowing as well as I did that jogging her memory could trigger an episode. 
                            <br>“I don't remember. Dinner, I think. You couldn't remember what you needed to buy.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And then the phone had gone quiet.  And I heard that crunching noise - it was the nose of her car ploughing into the ground - and my voice screamed down the phone. My thumbs were frantic. 999. I directed the paramedics. I met them at the hospital. Her parents couldn't get to Scotland in time. Her mother sobbed down the phone down to me. I'm so sorry, Barbara. I'd said. She might pull through. And I sat and held her hand, and tried not to look at the damage, the blood in her hair, the wires and tubes, the red welt the seatbelt left across her collarbone, at how she was wilting...  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Claire opened the door, her shoes crushing gravel as she slowly coaxed herself out of the car. She kept one hand on the vehicle, steadying herself as she looked at where the fence at the edge of the road had been split by her car. The clouds were withholding snow, refusing to kill the flowers just yet.
                            <br>“They can only revive you if you've been dead less than forty eight hours, right?”
                            <br>I got out of the car, mirroring her stance. We stood at the end of her world.
                            <br>“We had to spend a day without you.” I said it softly, without looking at her. I could tell what she was thinking. We'd found her a donor incredibly quickly for something as sought-after as revivification. Normally, there was a huge waiting list. People arranged transfusions months, sometimes years in advance. Compatibilities needed to be checked, forms signed, consents given. But our donor came forward in less than two days, arriving with Barbara at the airport. Everything went smoothly. The donor's funeral was held later that afternoon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the way back home, I admitted to Claire who her donor was. I told her that it was far easier to graft two flowers of the same family together than it was to graft two strangers. She nodded in understanding, closing her eyes as we drove back over the bridge. She sounded relieved as she played with the forget-me-not.
                            <br>“We did like the same things,” she said, breathing out,  “Him and me both.”
                        </p>
